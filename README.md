# Exact diagonalization routines for tight-binding models

This repository contains a collection of my Mathematica nodebooks and scripts related to exact diagonalization of tight-binding models for topological phases as well as computation of some of the common topological invariants. >>>>>>> cb68d07 (Added functions for exact diagonalization with interfaces and example notebook on Weyl semimetal interfaces.)
